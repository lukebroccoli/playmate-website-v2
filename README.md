# Playmate, an onlyfans competitor. 

TODO: need to figure out what are the key functions that onlyfans creators would want for me to build, and how I can deliver value asap for them to start using my product. 

Design a hydration screen so that the page does not bug out when I am first loading into it

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.2.0. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
